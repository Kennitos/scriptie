I'm very appreciate if you give credit and upvotes to this notebook :). Suggestion on this notebook is very expected, Thanks!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Notebook Goals\nThis notebook will carry out sentiment analysis with unsupervised learning approach even though a supervised learning approach can be done because there are target labels in the data. Because the results of scraping a web data are raw data where data do not have a target label and sentiment analysis cannot be carried out with a supervised learning approach.\n\nWord2Vec will be used as a word representation and K-Means will be used to cluster data.\n\n# Notebook Workflows\n* [1. Import Library](#ImportLibrary)\n* [2. Load Data](#LoadData)\n* [3. Data Preprocessing](#DataPreprocessing)\n* [4. Word2Vec Model Training](#Word2VecTraining)\n* [5.
