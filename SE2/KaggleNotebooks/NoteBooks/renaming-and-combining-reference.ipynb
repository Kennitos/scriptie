There are three core methods for doing this. In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat`, `join`, and `merge`.

Given a list of elements, it will smashes those elements together along an axis.\n\nThis is useful when we have data in different `DataFrame` or `Series` objects with the same fields (columns). One example: the [YouTube Videos dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new), which splits the data up based on country of origin (e.g. Canada and the UK, in this example).
