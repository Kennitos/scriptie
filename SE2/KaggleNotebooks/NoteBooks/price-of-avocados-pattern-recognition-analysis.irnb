Why? well I am always open to feedback from the community and it makes it more interesting for me to receive feedback from the community while I am working on this project. This explains my methodology of publishing my projects before they are done. Nevertheless, updates will come throughout the following months but remember I am still balancing my time due to school, external projects and other extra-curricular activites. I will try to make interesting updates as I learn more in detail everything with regards to time series forecasting using R. I am new in this topic especially when it comes to using R as my tool for analysis. I am excited to share all the things I learn with regards to time series forecasting with the community. Thanks to the community for always providing me with support and positive feedback. Let's begin!\n\nIn this kernel I will explore everyhting related to time series forecasting using R. I will be updating this kernel as time goes by because I want to learn as much as possible how the time series libraries work using R and to know all its component. This project will be extensive but really useful fr the community to learn about all the different parametersthat compose the time series forecasting. I hope you enjoy this journey no one said it was going to be easy but the hard work will reward both the community and myself. Wait for further updates! <br><br>\n\n<h3>Reference: </h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Terms to Know: </h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Explanatory model:</b> Is a model that adds variables into our model not only based on past historical prices (in this case Avocados prices), but uses other variables to make accurate predictions. </li>\n    <li><b>Time Series Model: </b> is a model that only uses past information (in this case past avocado prices) to make accurate predictions. </li>\n    </ul>\n    \n<h3>Steps for our Forecasting Project: </h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Determine what is the problem:</b> In this case we want to have accurate forecast of Avocado prices. </li>\n    <li><b>Gathering Information: </b> Understand what was the process that was used to gather the information and if the information is sufficient to have effective predictive models. </li>\n    <li><b>Implementing Exploratory Analysis: </b> Determine if there are any sort of patterns in our data before going into building the models. </li>\n    <li><b>Choosing predictive models: </b> This is the phase were we decide which model is the most appropiate to make our forecasting most effective.  </li>\n    <li><b>Testing our model: </b> Analyze if our model is effective enough to make effective predictions. </li>\n    </ul>\n    \n    \n<h4>Outline:</h4>\nI. <b>Introduction</b> <br>\na.

While for 2016 and 2017 the density of the prices were a little bit higher. </li>\n    <li><b>Price peaks per Month: </b> It looks that most price peaks occur for both conventional and organic avocados between the months of <b>September </b> and <b>October</b>. </li>\n    <li><b>Major drop in prices at the end of the year: </b> Interesting enough we see that at the end of the year there is a major price drop in the price of avocados. I wonder why that would be? What possible reason could there be to have a lower price at the end of each year. </li>\n    <li><b>Standard deviation as a measure of volatility: </b> Standard deviation is just the square root of a variance. We can see that during the year of 2017, the avocado market experienced the highest volatility for both conventional and organic avocados.</li>\n    <li><b> Percent differences for conventional avocados: </b> Here we want to see if there is a percent increase from year to year when it comes to the average price per month of each type of avocado. From 2015 - 2016 we see that the conventional avocados had a lag in the first six months of the year, then it picked for the next six months. From 2016 - 2017 conventional avocados performed greatly in the year of 2017 as opposed to the year of 2016 when compared to the previous year which was 2016. </li>\n    <li><b>Percent differences for organic avocados:</b> Now for organic avocados is a totally different story at least for the years 2015 - 2016. In 2016 organic avocados performed worst in almost all months as opposed to the previous year of 2015. Then it performed better in the year of 2017 in almost all the months of 2017 as opposed to the previous year of 2016. </li>\n    <li><b>2017 a good year for avocados: </b>Based on this trend, we can see that 2017 was a good year for avocados, would our forecast (later in this project) predict that it will do so in the year of 2018? </li>\n     </ul>\n     \n     \n <h4> <b> Formulas important to

So what is the main purpose of using Autocorrelations and how could it help us determine certain patterns in our time series dataset? First thing, the word \"Auto\" gives us a hint that we are planning to use an internal correlation. What does internal correlation mean? We basically are taking a specific date (in the example below we use January) and we want to see whether the price of avocados have some sort of correlation with the price of January. In the first visualization, lags are a representation of months. So we can see that the correlation is higher the closer the month is from January/ This means that the price of February are similar to the avocado prices of January. As the months pass by, the correlation as opposed to the month of January gets lower indicating to us that there are no specific patterns to the month of January. Price movements in those months except for February and March do not have highly correlated prices compared to the prices of January.\n\n<b> Reference for this section:</b> <br>\nhttps://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~magpn/Research/LSTS/STSIntro.html\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b7c3788a6f414d42b16b5157f2c8158f9392af57","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"options(repr.plot.width=10, repr.plot.height=6)\n\nseasonality_trends_conv <- window(conv.price, start=2015)\nconv_plot_trends <- autoplot(seasonality_trends_conv) + theme_economist() + \ntheme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12), plot.background=element_rect(fill=\"#F4F6F7\")) + \nlabs(x=\"Year\", y=\"Average Price\", title=\"Conventional Avocados\")\n\nautocoor_conv <- ggAcf(org.price, lag=12) + \ntheme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12), plot.background=element_rect(fill=\"#F4F6F7\")) + labs(title=\"Autocorrelation for \\n Conventional Avocados\")\n\n\nseasonality_trends_org <- window(org.price, start=2015)\norg_plot_trends <- autoplot(seasonality_trends_org) + theme_economist() + \ntheme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12), plot.background=element_rect(fill=\"#F4F6F7\")) + \nlabs(x=\"Year\", y=\"Average Price\", title=\"Organic Avocados\")\n\nautocoor_org <- ggAcf(org.price, lag=12) + \ntheme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12), plot.background=element_rect(fill=\"#F4F6F7\")) + labs(title=\"Autocorrelation for \\n Organic Avocados\")\n\nplot_grid(conv_plot_trends, autocoor_conv, org_plot_trends, autocoor_org, ncol=2, nrow=2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"77fd60cf5819e6b731cbf4cb5cb1d32e4b180b36"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3><b> Weekly Autocorrelations: </b></h3>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4899c8846eb9b4bc37ec5bd40071cec5952be19a","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"options(repr.plot.width=10, repr.plot.height=6)\n\n# Let's get it by week the average price\nweekly_df <- original_df\nweekly_df$week <- format(as.Date(original_df$Date), \"%w\")\n\nconv.price.weekly <- weekly_df %>% select(type,year,AveragePrice) %>% filter(type == \"conventional\", year == c(\"2015\", \"2016\", \"2017\")) \norg.price.weekly <- weekly_df %>% select(type,year,AveragePrice) %>% filter(type == \"organic\", year == c(\"2015\", \"2016\", \"2017\")) \n\n\nweekly.conv.price <- ts(conv.price.weekly$AveragePrice, start=2015, frequency=12)\nweekly.org.price <- ts(org.price.weekly$AveragePrice, start=2015, frequency=12)\n\n\n\nweekly_trends_conv <- window(weekly.conv.price, start=2015)\n\nweekly_trends_org <- window(weekly.org.price, start=2015)\n\nconv_plot_weekly <- autoplot(weekly_trends_conv) + theme_economist() + \ntheme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12), plot.background=element_rect(fill=\"#FFF1E0\")) + \nlabs(x=\"Time\", y=\"Average Price\", title=\"Conventional Avocados \\n (Weekly Time Series)\")\n\norg_plot_weekly <- autoplot(weekly_trends_org) + theme_economist() + \ntheme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12), plot.background=element_rect(fill=\"#FFF1E0\")) + \nlabs(x=\"Time\", y=\"Average Price\", title=\"Organic Avocados \\n (Weekly Time Series)\")\n\nautocoor_conv <- ggAcf(weekly.conv.price, lag=156, fill=\"#48a4ff\") + theme_economist() + \ntheme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12), plot.background=element_rect(fill=\"#FFF1E0\")) + \nlabs(title=\"Autocorrelations by Weekly Lags\")\n\nautocoor_org <- ggAcf(weekly.org.price, lag=156, fill=\"#48a4ff\") + theme_economist() + \ntheme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, size=12), plot.background=element_rect(fill=\"#FFF1E0\")) + \nlabs(title=\"Autocorrelations by Weekly Lags\")\n\nplot_grid(conv_plot_weekly, autocoor_conv,org_plot_weekly,  autocoor_org, ncol=2, nrow=2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"44d8172c22186a3a71777554dc06b9ad0b20f5d4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>Various Forecasting Methods: </h2>\n<a id=\"methods\"></a>\nIn this section we will use various models to come up with accurate predictions in order to see what will the upcoming patterns will be for avocado prices.<br><br>\n\nThe list of models we will use include:\n<ul>\n    <li>Smoothing Moving Average </li>\n    <li>Seasonal Naive Method </li>\n    <li>Drift Method </li>\n    <li>ARIMA </li>\n    </ul>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fc60a5e61753a8fcf893534bbe4f2d8940d2eb6c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Using Smoothing average\nsma_conv <- sma(conventional$AveragePrice, h=10, silent=FALSE) + theme_economist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>Using Naive and Drift Methods: </h3>\nBefore explaining how these types of forecasting models work there are a couple of things that we must understand:\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Average Method: </b> This is just the average line of the last three years that we are analyzing. These years are 2015, 2016 and 2017. This will give us a fix value however, this value is important. When we talk about technical analysis, whenever prices go below the average line we are \"expected\" to see a downward trend. </li>\n    <li><b>Naive Method: </b> Is just setting all forecast values to the last value we saw. You can see that the blue line is at the same level of the last price in December. That explain why it is so low! Since the avocado price was so low for both conventional and organic avocados, this could have a similar functionality to a support line.
