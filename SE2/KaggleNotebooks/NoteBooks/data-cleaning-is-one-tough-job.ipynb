The city has partnered with Kaggle to create a competition to improve the job bulletins that will fill all those open positions.\n\nProblem Statement\nThe content, tone, and format of job bulletins can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly-specific job requirements may discourage diversity. The Los Angeles Mayor’s Office wants to reimagine the city’s job bulletins by using text analysis to identify needed improvements.\n\nThe goal is to convert a folder full of plain-text job postings into a structured CSV file and then to use this data to: (1) identify language that can negatively bias the pool of applicants; (2) improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool; and/or (3) make it easier to determine which promotions are available to employees in each job class.\n\nHow to Participate\nAccept the Rules\nAccept the competition rules.\nMake Your Submission\nFollow the submission instructions.\nWIth your help, Los Angeles will overcome a wave of retirements and fill those jobs with a strong and diverse workforce. Good luck and happy Kaggling!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Lets open one of the job bulletins to
